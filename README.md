# Terrarium
Just another python exersize 


This is a Python program that simulates a life of some kind of creatures in a randomly created terrain. They can do basic moves like - move to other cell and eat if there's something to eat. 

Project info:
      - You'd like to install - TERMCOLOR ( a python package for colored prints), so that the prints will work

You can do that with - 'pip install termcolor' executed in the bash. 
This package will allow you, as i said, to use colored prints.
